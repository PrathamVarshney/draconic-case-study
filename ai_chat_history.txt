[ChatGPT]: 
Here’s a hint for Task B: Financial News Impact Analyzer from the Draconic case study.

🎯 Goal Recap  
Build a multi-agent system using Pydantic AI that analyzes financial news articles and assesses market impact.

🔍 Key Hints

1. Define at least two specialized agents:
   - Sentiment Agent – analyzes sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) from the headline and content.
   - Market Impact Agent – uses sentiment and financial context to estimate stock or market impact.

2. Agents must communicate:
   - Sentiment Agent feeds its analysis to Market Impact Agent.
   - Handle disagreements with rules (e.g., majority voting, confidence score).

3. Suggested Evaluation Metrics:
   - Sentiment Consistency
   - Market Impact Prediction Accuracy
   - Agent Agreement Rate

4. Prompt Iteration:
   - Example: Refine prompts like "What is the sentiment?" → "How would a financial analyst interpret this article's tone?"

5. Test Case Tip:
   - FIN-001 (Tesla): Positive earnings + cautionary forecast → mixed sentiment → complex decision.
